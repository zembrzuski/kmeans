Hello

If you run this code in your machine, you will see each iteration
of k-means working, and if you are interested in these things,
you will be happy.

I made this program to practice my skills with the R language.

I am not good at all with this language yet, and the code seems
very strange to me sometimes. I think it happens because most of
the time made the programs using Java, which is an object oriented
language and a strong typed language.
